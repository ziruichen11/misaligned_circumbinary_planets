# misaligned_circumbinary_planets
circumbinary.ipynb generates and evolves a population of circumbinary planets. It pulls out stellar masses from the masses.xlsx file, which is an excel spreadsheet containing stellar masses of Kepler targets.

The data of different populations.rar file contains the data (transit counts per epoch, # of epoches in one Kepler window, and inclination of binary orbit) we obtained from evolving circumbinary populations with different inclination distributions.
